## About this project

This repository adds native support for Cloud Foundry spaces, service instances and service bindings to Kubernetes clusters.
It contains custom resource definitions

- `spaces.cf.cs.sap.com` (kind `Space`)
- `clusterspaces.cf.cs.sap.com` (kind `ClusterSpace`)
- `serviceinstances.cf.cs.sap.com` (kind `ServiceInstance`)
- `servicebindings.cf.cs.sap.com` (kind `ServiceBinding`)

and an according operator reconciling resources of these types.

A typical usage could look as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cf.cs.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: Space
metadata:
  name: k8s
spec:
  organizationName: my-org 
  authSecretName: k8s-space
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: k8s-space
stringData:
  url: "<cf api url>"
  username: "<username>"
  password: "<password>"
---
apiVersion: cf.cs.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: uaa
spec:
  spaceName: k8s
  serviceOfferingName: xsuaa
  servicePlanName: application
---
apiVersion: cf.cs.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: uaa
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: uaa
```

When reconciling these objects, the operator will ensure that according API entities (space, instance, binding) are maintained in the
targeted Cloud Foundry environment.

The scope of this project is comparable with the [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator).
But other than that operator, the Cloud Foundry Service Operator provided by this repository manages services and bindings through
Cloud Foundry APIs, instead of using native BTP APIs.

## Requirements and Setup

The recommended deployment method is to use the [Helm chart](https://github.com/sap/cf-service-operator-helm):

```bash
helm upgrade -i cf-service-operator oci://ghcr.io/sap/cf-service-operator-helm/cf-service-operator
```
